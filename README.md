# DeejV2

This project was inspired by https://github.com/omriharel/deej all credit where credit is do!

1. If you wanna do the same I did for what ever reason
    - Print out or manufacture your own case for the stuff
    - Assemble the stuff and flash the arduinos
    - Setup Ini file and test it to make sure it works by running the reader
    - If that doesn't work make sure you have the Volume Changer in the same folder.
    - profit?


2. Need to Fix
	- Get it to work mostly
	- Gotta figure out the changing bit so that works
